  # replace image with actual compiled name
  image: socvr/graverobber
  
# once this file is customized, follow these steps:

# To get this program running in docker, follow these steps:
#
# 1) Customize this file.
#    For now, all you need to do is change the image name, but if you may keep this setting
#    or add settings of your own. Once you are done ensure the file is called "docker-compose.yml"
#    (you need to strip off the ".example" from the file extension).
#
#    You may wish to add "container_name" if you plan on having multiple version of this program
#    running or have a large amount of other docker containers on the computer.
#
# 2) Build the image.
#    From the root directory for this repository, run this command:
#
#        docker build -t <desired-image-name> .
#
#    Replace <desired-image-name> with what you want the image to be called. Suggestion is "socvr/graverobber".
#    You may also add a version number or version name (add ":1.0.0" or ":primary" to the end of the image name).
#    Remember, it is important to put a period at the end of the command. This tells the builder
#    to use the current directory.
#
# 3) Compose the service
#    Use the following command to start the program in the docker system:
#
#        docker-compose up -d
#
#    This uses this file (the docker-compose.yml file) in the current directory to create a new container
#    or update the existing one.
